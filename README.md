This sample is **NOT** a seed project. Do not use it as one.
It is used as an example of how to use the Authboss API. This means if
you copy-paste code from this sample you are likely opening yourself
up to various security holes, bad practice, and bad design.
It's a demonstration of the surface API of Authboss and how the library
can be used to make a functioning web project.
